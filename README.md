Welcome to our Github repository.

At Forenxics we like to use and provide functional code. 
The code must be robust and easy to use. Our Docker containers once released will work with no problems.
There are many fantastic opensource software packages available. 
What many are missing is the time of good developers and as a result the project dies.
